We’ve always been in awe of the power of music: the way it inspires us, shaping our emotions in a way that words alone cannot. Yet, often times, we have found that we struggle to find just the right song to match our mood. And so the idea for Moodify was born. Not only does this app give you a daily song recommendation, but it also gives you song recommendations based on your mood! Whether you’re sad, happy, or bored - we have the song for you!

This is the repository for the MIT Blueprint 2021 mobile development (iOS) track.
